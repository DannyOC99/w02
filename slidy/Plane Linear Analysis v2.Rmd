# Table Of Contents

- A Discussion on what we will be looking at
  - A brief look at the table
  - Summary Statistics for the Necessary Variables
- Looking at the slope and graph for each linear model
  - Delayed Flight vs Minutes of Late Arrival
  - Delayed Flight vs Bagging Time
  - Delayed Flight vs Time in security
- Conclusions
  - Which had the highest slope?
  - Which had the highest correlation


# Discussion {.bigger}

- We want to take a look at 3 different variables and see how they affect arrival time.
- Specifically we will be looking at how Flight Delay interacts with
  - Late Arrival Time (in minutes)
  - Baggage Loading Time (in minutes)
  - Time in Security (in minutes)

# Insight into data

```{r eval=requireNamespace("DT", quietly=TRUE)}
DT::datatable(flights_data, fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 10))
```

# Summary Statistics for Arrival Time

```{r}
knitr::kable(summary(flights_data))
```

# Linear Analyses {.bigger}

- For this section we will be looking at the different Linear Relationships Delayed Flight has with Baggage Loading, Late Arrival, and Security Time
- We will also be recording the slope and correlation of the relationship

# Delayed Flight vs Late Arrival

- In this relationship, our flight Delay will increase by 24.56196 minutes for every 1 minute increase in Late Arrival. This relationship has a correlation of 0.66684 

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(flights$Late_Arrival_o,flights$Arr_Delay,xlab='Minutes Late', ylab= 'Flight Delay (mins)')
abline(lm(flights$Arr_Delay ~ flights$Late_Arrival_o))
```

# Delayed Flight vs Baggage Time

- In this relationship, Flight Delay increases by 33.54257 minutes for every 1 minute increase in baggage loading time 

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(flights$Baggage_loading_time,flights$Arr_Delay,xlab='Time to bag (minutes)', ylab= 'Flight Delay (mins)')
abline(lm(flights$Arr_Delay ~ flights$Baggage_loading_time))
```

# Delayed Flight vs Security Time

- As seen Below, time in security has no linear relationship with a Delayed Flight

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(flights$Security_o,flights$Arr_Delay,xlab='Security Time (minutes)', ylab= 'Delayed Flight (mins)')
abline(lm(flights$Arr_Delay ~ flights$Security_o))
```

# Conclusions

- After Looking at these 2 relationships, it is clear which one will be the best to model Flight Delay.
- With both a higher slope and a higher correlation, we can see that Baggage Time will have more of an effect and increase in Departure Delay
